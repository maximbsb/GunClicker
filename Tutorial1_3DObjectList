# 3D Object List
This shows how to make a scrollable list of 3D objects that spawn when the game begins.

## 1. Create a new scene

Start by creating a new scene called `GameScene`.

Add a scroll view by clicking on GameObject -> UI -> Scroll View

Expand the newly added Scroll View and delete "Scrollbar Horizontal" and "Scrollbar Vertical"

Select the Scroll View game object. In the "Transform" component, press on the "Anchor Presets" button. 

Select the Scroll View game object, find the "Image" component and change the color to black by clicking on the field. Then in the newly poped-up window, set R, B, G to 0 and set A (transparency) to 1.

Close the color picker window. Right-click on the "Source Image" field and press delete to remove the sprite from the image.

## 2. Next Step

Example of how to make a code area:
```.cs
[RequireComponent(typeof(SphereCollider))]
public class Vision : MonoBehaviour
{
    public SphereCollider viewDistance;
}
```
