# Gun Clicker
Hi, welcome to this tutorial series!

In this series of tutorials, we will create a clicker game, where you have to click on guns to earn points and spend points to unlock new guns until you've unlocked them all! Very simple game that is perfect for beginners.

By the end of this series, you will learn how to:
* Make a scrollable list
* Populate the scrollable list with items at runtime
* Create a score system
* Create scriptable objects
* Optimize instantiation of objects using a pooling system
* Use getters and setters for encapsulation
* Use events for a better encapsulation of the code

By the end of the 4 tutorials, you will probably have something very similar to this result:

But if you decide to keep working on the game by adding gun animations, more particle effects and post processing, it may look something like this:
