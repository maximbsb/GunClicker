Today I started working on my game Gun Clicker. The idea of the game is to shoot a gun by clicking on it, score points, reload it, upgrade it and then level up to a newer, better gun by putting the new gun's parts together. I decided to make this particular game because it mostly relies on code and isn't that reliant on animations and art.
